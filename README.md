# Hey Day
A script to celebrate the best Wednesday in October. War Eagle!

##About this Script
This script is in celebration of the Auburn University tradition, Hey Day. On this special Wednesday in October, everyone on campus wears a nametag and says "Hey!" to everyone they meet. It's a fun way to make Auburn feel welcoming. 

This script uses the ```read``` command to allow the user to enter their name. It then greets them with a hearty, ```echo "Hey, $name!"```.

##Motivation
This script was written as a fun way to pay homage to the Loveliest Village on the Plains.
